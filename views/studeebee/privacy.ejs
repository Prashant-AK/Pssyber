							<h4>StudeeBee Privacy Policy </h4>
							<p class='policy-para'>When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information.
								We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and
								put you in control.</p>
							<p>This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we
								collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.
								<br>
								You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you
								can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails
								and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services
								when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google
								or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome
								in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to
								control what we collect and how your information is used.

							<h4>Information we Collect</h4>

							<p>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services
								We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out
								basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll
								find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you
								might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends
								on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
